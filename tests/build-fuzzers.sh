# This script is supposed to be compatible with OSS-Fuzz, i.e. it has to use
# environment variables like $CC, $CFLAGS and $OUT, link the fuzz targets with CXX
# (even though the project is written in C) and so on:
# https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/new-project-guide/#buildsh

# The fuzz targets it builds can't make any assumptions about
# their runtime environment apart from /tmp being writable:
# https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/further-reading/fuzzer-environment/ .
# Even though it says there that it's possible to link fuzz targets against
# their dependencies dynamically by moving them to $OUT and changing
# rpath, it tends to break coverage reports from time to time https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/6524
# so all the dependencies are linked statically here.

# This script is configured via https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/elfutils/project.yaml
# and used to build the elfutils project on OSS-Fuzz with three fuzzing engines
# (libFuzzer, AFL++ and honggfuzz) on two architectures (x86_64 and i386)
# with three sanitizers (ASan, UBSan and MSan) with coverage reports on top of
# all that: https://oss-fuzz.com/coverage-report/job/libfuzzer_asan_elfutils/latest
# so before changing anything ideally it should be tested with the OSS-Fuzz toolchain
# described at https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/advanced-topics/reproducing/#building-using-docker
# by running something like:
#
# ./infra/helper.py pull_images
# ./infra/helper.py build_image --no-pull elfutils
# for sanitizer in address undefined memory; do
#   for engine in libfuzzer afl honggfuzz; do
#     ./infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --clean --sanitizer=$sanitizer --engine=$engine elfutils PATH/TO/ELFUTILS
#     ./infra/helper.py check_build --sanitizer=$sanitizer --engine=$engine -e ALLOWED_BROKEN_TARGETS_PERCENTAGE=0 elfutils
#   done
# done
#
# ./infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --clean --architecture=i386 elfutils PATH/TO/ELFUTILS
# ./infra/helper.py check_build --architecture=i386 -e ALLOWED_BROKEN_TARGETS_PERCENTAGE=0 elfutils
#
# ./infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --clean --sanitizer=coverage elfutils PATH/TO/ELFUTILS
# ./infra/helper.py coverage --no-corpus-download --fuzz-target=fuzz-dwfl-core --corpus-dir=PATH/TO/ELFUTILS/tests/fuzz-dwfl-core-crashes/ elfutils
#
# It should be possible to eventually automate that with ClusterFuzzLite https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/
# but it doesn't seem to be compatible with buildbot currently.

# The script can also be used to build and run the fuzz target locally without Docker.
# After installing clang and the build dependencies of libelf by running something
# like `dnf build-dep elfutils-devel` on Fedora or `apt-get build-dep libelf-dev`
# on Debian/Ubuntu, the following commands should be run:
#
#  $ ./tests/build-fuzzers.sh
#  $ ./out/fuzz-dwfl-core tests/fuzz-dwfl-core-crashes/
